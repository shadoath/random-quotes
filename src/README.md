# Random Quote Machine

Objective: To build an app that will build random quotes that users can favorite.

This project needs to use React. Along with that, you can use any library you choose that you believe will help you in accomplishing the task. The random quotes should not be stored in the app, but should be retrieved using an API. (Here is a possible source: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/camperbot/5a022b72e96c4c9585c32bf6a75f62d9/raw/e3c6895ce42069f0ee7e991229064f167fe8ccdc/quotes.json)

- User story #1: On page load, I can see a box with a random quote in it, as well as its author.
- User story #2: There should exist a "New Quote" button that will update the quote with another quote.
- User story #3: There should exist a clickable icon that will favorite the quote.
- User story #4: There should be a button to show and hide my favorite quotes.
- User story #5: My favorite quotes should persist between refreshes (you can store the favorites in localStorage, or for extra credit you can try to store in a mongo database.)

Note: This project is based on the Random Quote Machine project for Free Code Camp. So you may want to start there for inspiration.
